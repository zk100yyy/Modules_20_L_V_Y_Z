# Kai, Porject Idea

## 1. [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

![Titanic](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X2HayNRX94wPEBtGqg7MJE.jpg "Titanic")

one of the most popular data set for machine learning on Kaggle.

"legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works."

## Personly opinion
**Pro** : Many example, perfectly fit for the project.

**Con** : bit too popular and well known.

## 2. [Credit Score Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification)

![credit score](https://www.nerdwallet.com/assets/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/credit-score-range.png "credit score")

Given a person’s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.

## Personly opinion
**Pro** : Nothing can go wrong

**Con** : Nothing special

## 3. [Classic Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)

![Iris Flower](https://hgtvhome.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/grdn/fullset/2014/2/5/0/12-waltersgardens-hi14643-irisautumn-circus.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.1280.853.suffix/1452644697576.jpeg "Iris Flower")

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
use the data to build the ML to Classification each species.

## Personly opinion
**Pro** : Nothing can go wrong

**Con** : Nothing special,and bit too well known

## 4. [World Cup](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017)

![World Cup](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e3/2022_FIFA_World_Cup.svg/1200px-2022_FIFA_World_Cup.svg.png "World Cup")

This dataset includes 43,170 results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1972 up to 2022.Base on the Data to predict the 2022 World Cup Winner.

## Personly opinion
**Pro** : Sounds fun (to me)

**Con** : Not fun to non-footballer, also the project will not be relevant to the real life (not good for presentation).


## 5. ~~_Kai special crazy funny,not realistic idea_~~

![Cena](https://media-exp2.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQHI9dREmJVc5g/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1614806815510?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=qLwbWFwZKS0WQfbPG80lC1MaRRROtmx8M-x9_L2B_Zs "Cena")

~~Cena or not Cena. build simple face recognition ML basic on grope + Cena,and train it to recognize Cena face , like the pizza or not pizza.~~
