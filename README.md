The Titanic

Why we picked this Topic: 

The initial data surrounding this topic's is relatively more accessible. With this being such a public event, it has been studied by different researchers, and analysts since the “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg in 1912. 
The source of data: 

By using two sets of data, train.cvs and test.csv, we hope to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic

Questions hope to answer with the data: 

Considering different ages and status, we hope to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?”
