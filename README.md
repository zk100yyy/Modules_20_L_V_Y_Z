Our Selected Topic: The Titanic
Why we picked this Topic: Because this topic's initial data is relatively more accessible,the event itself has been a public focus ever since the “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg in 1912.
The source of data: We will use two data sets for this project,one dataset is titled train.csv and the other is titled test.csv.
Questions hope to answer with the data: With the passengers being in different ages and socioeconomic status, many people fortunately survived and many died,We want to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?"
