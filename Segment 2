•	Description of preliminary data preprocessing
The Titanic shipwreck was a massive disaster, so we will implement data pre- processing on this data set to know the number of survivors and their details. 
First, we start off by importing all the data into our system. In our case we imported the data into Jupyter Note, Panda and SQL. Next, we will be dropping columns that don’t contribute much to our model such as 
“name, ticket, cabin etc.”. If needed, we can drop the rows with missing values (NaN). We then convert “Pclass, Sex, Embarked values” into columns, dropping the same 
columns from the data frame. To handle the missing value, age, we compute a median of all the ages. Jumping into splitting the data set into training set and test set. 
The dataset is split 70% training and 30% test. 

•	Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including the decision-making process
Preliminary feature engineering includes gender, deck, family size, age* classification, and fare per person. 

•	Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
 For the training set was based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class., we provide the outcome for each passenger. 
 For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. We predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use used the model to predict
 whether they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
